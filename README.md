Jorts is a JavaScript library for short-scaling numbers, as in 

> "1,234 vs. 8,234" -> "1K vs. 8K"

Such abbreviation puts focus on magnitude & comparison rather than accuracy & precision, saves screen ink, and conserves energy that'd otherwise be lost through the tongue.

Short-scaling is a well known concept (http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Long_and_short_scales.) But when to scale, and to what precision, is domain-specific. This library has an opinion about what's best (see the tests.)
