Jorts is for short-scaling numbers for comparisons, as in "1K" instead of "1,231" and "8K" instead of "8,265".

Such abbreviation puts focus on magnitude & comparison, rather than accuracy & precision. It saves mental, vocal, and screen ink for more important things.

Short-scaling is a well known concept (http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Long_and_short_scales.) But when to scale, and to what precision, is domain-specific. This library has an opinion about what's best (see the tests.)
